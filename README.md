# dead-by-daylight-randomizer
With this randomizer, you can randomize Dead by Daylight perks.

I wanted to try new builds in the game, and wanted to experiment with the Vue. Hence this project.

You can choose which perks you want to be included from the "Included perks" dialog. The selections are stored in local storage, so your selections will stay recorded the next time you open the site.
